I was fairly happy with my Fire TV but for me there was one thing missing. I go to a Church that streams the services and I if I can't make it because of my disability I watch it on my iPad . Of course friends with Apple TV's always told me how easy it was to use AirPlay and whatever they were watching on their iPad they could see on their TV. I also watch the Pirelli World Challenge on live stream and get tired of watching it on my iPad. So yesterday I went on a Google hunt for a resolution to my problem. One of the top answers was AirPlay/DLNA Receiver (Pro). So I checked it out in the App Store and I used my coins I never use to pay for the purchase. What a simple set up, even for this amateur , and thankfully the instructions come up right in the middle of the screen . I was set up and watching video on my TV in less than 5 minutes. This really is a MUST BUY for any Fire TV owner. I am all excited for the time I am going to get watching videos etc on my big screen in the future. I wish I had searched for this earlier. Last night when I was setting up I actually first connected and mirrored from my iPhone 6 and to see that 4\" screen on a 42\" monitor was just sweet. I also must say I don't understand where do many one star reviews came from and all the recent ones are the more deserving 5 star variety, I only can surmise that an earlier version must have been buggy. If you have a PC , iMac . Galaxy S6, iPhone or iPad this app is for you. It just works with everything and best of all it just works !!"},{"rating": "4.0", "votes": "One", "author": "Randall R.

So be prepared for significant lag and a low frame rate/screen redraw. This is good to cast static or stable images such as a simple presentation or map, however if you intend on using it to cast HD video (local or streaming) from your idevice to your HDTV, then I would highly recommend you instead purchase a Lightning HDMI Digital Video Adapter, which will video mirror your iDevice in full hi-res 1080p with absolutely no lag/latency.

The better app is \"AirPlay&UPnP\" which also shows up as \"AirReceiver\" which cost me $3.20 after taxes.  \"AirPlay&UPnP\" will do everything you want except play videos you bought through iTunes.

Two tips that weren't immediately apparent: 1) the iPad mirroring control is in the swipe-up menu at the bottom of the screen next to the AirDrop option; and 2) sites such as tvids.net work but they're persnickety. The program hangs and then says the software can't read their format if I try to watch it full-screen, but it works if I start it on the small screen and then double-tap it to enlarge partway. If (when) it freezes or I want to rewind, I double-tap again to reduce the screen size before trying to adjust anything.

It runs in the background as soon as you start up your Amazon Fire device and you don't notice it. But from your phone, you can \"Airplay\" anything on your screen to your TV at a moment's notice. I especially like that this app will mirror your device while you are in the middle of watching something or doing something else with the Amazon Fire device. It automatically overrides what you're watching and gives priority to the \"Airplaying.\" Some context: we'll be watching Sling on our TV and I'll remember a funny Facebook or Youtube video that I want to show my wife.

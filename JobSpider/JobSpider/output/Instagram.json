Having problems with your game? These tips apply to most of the popular Android games today, I hope they help. Memory issues on your device can cause games to freeze or crash or just plain not function properly. The best way to fix these issues is to restart your device, which clears the memory (this will not cause any loss of data). Reset the game Resetting the game can also fix freezing issues. Next log out of Facebook, (very important Reboot) Then log back into Facebook to sync your scores. Update game software, Check the app store for updates to the game. Out of date software can lead to performance issues, including freezing and locking up. Finally, enjoy your games. If you have any questions please don't hesitate to ask me and I'd be happy to help.

The only thing with this phone is that it doesn't have your typically screen shot actions and doesn't work for instagram (our at least that I haven't figured out yet) so that's a bit of a bummer that up can't save pics, but I also don't like that the instagram app itself doesn't provide a good crop it's too small sometimes and I dislike that I have to download and store and entirely separate application for that.

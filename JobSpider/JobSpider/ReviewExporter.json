That opened the door to what's become a bit of an addiction.  Simply put, this game (and I suspect the entire series) is an easy one to pick up and play for a few minutes, but don't be surprised when those few minutes turn into hours!  The gameplay is simple to learn (I got 3 stars in almost every level of the first section and still surprise myself on some new levels) but challenging to master (some levels have proven difficult to get past 1 star)."},{"rating": "4.0", "votes": "7", "author": "Jason", "url": "https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R1BN3HKNUS4NO/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B009WO7NQO", "title": "A Fun Time Sink", "url_object_id": "9a65e237c0b76239d9a2ad1e7762ede4", "crawl_time": "2017-10-08 19:47:01", "date": "2014-04-22", "content": "Paying for the app is better than getting it free.

The first AB was simply amazing. But every other AB, excluding Space, used the same gameplay formula. It got a little repetitive. I guess the old addage held true: If it ain't broke, don't fix it. AB Space was the first to break the formula. And it was amazing. Let me just say, AB Star Wars is as ground breaking as it is fun. It mixes the gameplay of the original AB with that of AB Space. It a perfect balance of both. And the birds each have their own abilities. I won't go into that much detail about it though, you'll have to play it to see. And they used the Star Wars license perfectly. It tells (in a roundabout way) the story of Episode IV A New Hope, with Hoth coming soon, and includes the Path of the Jedi DLC. While I agree that $2.99 is a little steep in price, I must say that it is definitely worth it, especially to fans of past AB games and to Star Wars fans.

Everything was pretty much the same except for the lag I found on this version. It would have a slow react time and it would make the game play suffer because of it. Also docked down stars because some levels are impossible to beat without the use of a millenium falcon. When you reset the level you do NOT get them back and when you run out you can sometimes earn more as the game progresses, but ultimately you have to spend out of game money to purchase more to help you in game. That's kinda a rip off in my opinion.

The graphics are good, but the birds' powers are not.  I am fairly adept with the other versions of this game and enjoy the challenge of figuring out the necessary angles and trajectories needed to win the levels.  In this version it is extremely difficult to over come the handicap of weak bird powers and the inability to actually be able to aim the birds.  However, my 10 year old grandson, who is a whiz at the Angry Birds games, and also struggles with the version, is enough of a Star Wars fan to still enjoy it; thus the 3 star rating.  For my personal rating of enjoyment and playability I would not give it more than about a one and a half.

Five Stars !!  Angry Birds STAR WARS is a logical and well-done next step for fans of Angry Birds.  It is by far the BEST AB game for those who are even moderate fans of the movies.  Kindle version works great.  No issues at all.  My only wish would be for Rovio to send out the Kindle and other non-Apple versions same day as Apple versions.  I hate having to hear Apple owners talk about playing the new game that isn't available for me yet."},{"rating": "1.0", "votes": "5", "author": "S.
